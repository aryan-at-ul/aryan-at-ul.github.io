## Introduction to Königsberg

The concept of networks can be traced back to a famous problem in graph theory, the **Seven Bridges of Königsberg**. Königsberg, a city in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), faced a fascinating puzzle: how to walk through the city and cross each of its seven bridges exactly once, maybe some logistic challenge or just a puzzle if one walks too much around the city. 

This problem was solved by the mathematician **Leonhard Euler**, who laid the foundation for graph theory. [Bridges of Königsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg#:~:text=Two%20of%20the%20seven%20original,one%20was%20rebuilt%20in%201935), this historic briges were somewhat ruined duing the world war.
